## Data selection

We concatenate replicates samples from sites that suffered from amplification
problems.

## Environmental variables

The coordinates of the sites, latitude and longitude, were recorded during
sampling events. The distance from site to its spring and the site altitude were
extracted thank to a stream network reconstruction, which was done with the R
packages `openStars` and `SSN` [@kattwinkel_preparing_2020; @hoef_ssn:_2014].

## Statistical analysis

Community composition was analyzed through Non Metric Dimensional Scaling
(NMDS). The distance between community composition was computed with Bray-Curtis
distance. The representation of the community composition in the two dimensional
space was acceptable, with a stress value of `r round(mynmds$stress,2)`. To
explore how much the community composition, we fitted environmental variables
onto the ordination (`envfit` function in the `vegan` package). The
significativity of the fitted environmental variables through 999 permutations
of the community coordinates.

The species richness was modeled according to latitude, longitude, altitude,
distance from spring and the type of substrate with a
Poisson linear model. We found significative spatial autocorrelation in species
richness (Moran test: $I = 0.19$, $P = 0.005$, Figure SXX). Then we modeled
spatial correlation with an exponential correlation structure with `glmmPQL`
function in the `MASS` package. The validity of the model was assessed with the
visual inspection of the residuals. We also checked for the absence of
multicollinearity in the model specification with the Generalized Variance
Inflation Factor that were all inferior to two.


With the aim to get the assembly rules driving mussels community composition, we
computed species cooccurence. Cooccurence patterns between species translate
the influence of environmental constraints, species interactions and dispersal
limitation. The expected cooccurence between species pairs was compared to
observed cooccurence.  The expected cooccurence between a species pair is simply
the product of the probability of occurrence of the two species multiplied by
the total number of sites [@griffith_cooccur_2016]. The significativity of the
species cooccurence was assessed following the probabilistic model of
@veech_probabilistic_2013, with $\alpha = .1$. On the 780 species pair
combinations, 247 pairs (31.67 %)
were removed because they have an expected cooccurence superior to 1 were kept
in the analysis. The analysis of species cooccurence were done with the
`cooccur` R package [@griffith_cooccur_2016].

All the analysis were performed in R v3.6.3 [@r_core_team_r_2020] and the
scripts used for the analysis are available online [https://github.com/alaindanet/prie_mussels](https://github.com/alaindanet/prie_mussels).

# Results

## Composition

```{r nmds-test}
kable(result_compo,
  label = "nmds",
  caption = "Result of the fit of environmental variables
  onto ordination. r is the squared correlation coefficient between variable vectors and
  the ordination.")  %>% kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))
envfit
```


```{r}
nmds_caption <- paste0(
  "Non Metrics Dimensional Scaling of species composition. Each point represent
  a site. The vectors represent the direction which the continuous variables
  change the most fastly in the ordination space and the direction which they
  have maximal correlation with the ordination. The label of the factors
  represent their average position in the ordination space."

) 
```

```{r nmds, fig.cap=nmds_caption}
include_graphics(path = get_mypath("fig", "nmds.png"))
```
The variables latitude, longitude, substrate and string distance were
significantly associated to the ordination axis, but not altitude (Figure
\@ref(fig:nmds), Table \@ref(tab:nmds)). Latitude and longitude were the
variables the most related to the community composition
(resp. $r^2 = `r signif(result_compo$r[1], 2)`$,
$r^2 = `r signif(result_compo$r[2], 2)`$).


## Species richness

    lower = Estimate - 1.96*SE, 
    upper = Estimate + 1.96*SE, 
  ) %>%

#Is you used log(y) instead of y, the model is

   #= exp(b0) * exp(b1*x1) * exp(b2*x2) * exp(error)
   #= exp(b0) * exp(b1)^x1 * exp(b2)^x2 * exp(error)

We found that species richness increase by $`r out[["Latitude"]]$Estimate`$
log-unit ($`r out[["Latitude"]]$SE`$ se) by latitude degree and increased by
$`r out[["Spring distance"]]$Estimate`$ log-unit 
($`r out[["Spring distance"]]$SE`$ se) by meter distance from the spring (Figure
\@ref(fig:rich), Table \@ref(tab:rich)). Species richness increased from 7.5 in
the south to 12.5 to the north of France while 9 in the vinicity of the springs
to 12 at 800km of the springs.  However, longitude and altitude had no
significant effects on species richness. We further found that
species richness was higher in acid and mixed substrate (9.5 species) than in calcareous
substrate (7.25 species; respectively the effects were of $`r out[["Acid"]]$Estimate`$ log-unit, 
$`r out[["Acid"]]$SE`$ se and $`r out[["Mixed"]]$Estimate`$ log-unit,
$`r out[["Mixed"]]$SE`$ se).

include_graphics(path = get_mypath("fig", "richness_model.png"))
```

## Cooccurence

```{r}
myload(cooc_bivalve, envir = environment(), dir = get_mypath("data"))
sum_cooc <- summary(cooc_bivalve)
```

```{r co-mat}
ggdraw() + draw_image(image =
  "~/Dropbox/_0_MollEcol_2/_Review/Figures/assos_matrix.png")
```


Over the 533 species pairs analyzed, `r sum_cooc["Random"]` pairs were clasified
as random, `r sum_cooc["Positive"]` as positive and only
`r sum_cooc["Negative"]` as negative (Figure \@ref(fig:co-mat)). Swoo had the
most number of significant negative cooccurence with the other species while
Ehen had the most number of significant positive cooccurence (Figure \@ref(fig:co-mat)).


```{r co-pair}
ggdraw() + draw_image(image = "~/Dropbox/_0_MollEcol_2/_Review/Figures/pair_profile.png")
