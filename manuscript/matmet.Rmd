## Data selection

We concatenate replicates samples from sites that suffered from amplification
problems.

## Environmental variables

The coordinates of the sites, latitude and longitude, were recorded during
sampling events. The distance from site to its spring and the site altitude were
extracted thank to a stream network reconstruction, which was done with the R
packages `openStars` and `SSN` [@kattwinkel_preparing_2020; @hoef_ssn:_2014].

## Statistical analysis

Community composition was analyzed through Non Metric Dimensional Scaling
(NMDS). The distance between community composition was computed with Bray-Curtis
distance. The representation of the community composition in the two dimensional
space was acceptable, with a stress value of `r round(mynmds$stress,2)`. To
explore how much the community composition, we fitted environmental variables
onto the ordination (`envfit` function in the `vegan` package). The
significativity of the fitted environmental variables through 999 permutations
of the community coordinates.

The species richness was modeled according to latitude, longitude, altitude,
distance from spring and the type of substrate with a
Poisson linear model. We found significative spatial autocorrelation in species
richness (Moran test: $I = 0.19$, $P = 0.005$, Figure SXX). Then we modeled
spatial correlation with an exponential correlation structure with `glmmPQL`
function in the `MASS` package. The validity of the model was assessed with the
visual inspection of the residuals. We also checked for the absence of
multicollinearity in the predictor variables with the Generalized Variance
Inflation Factor that were all inferior to two.

To assess assembly rules of mussels communities, we computed the cooccurence between
species. Cooccurence patterns between species reflect the influence of
environmental constraints, species interactions and dispersal limitation. The
expected cooccurence between species pairs was compared to observed cooccurence.
The expected cooccurence between a species pair is simply the product of the
probability of occurrence of the two species multiplied by the total number of
sites [@griffith_cooccur_2016]. The significativity of the association was
assessed as ... with a threshold of 0.1, after the power analysis of
@veech_probabilistic_2013. Only the species pairs with an expected cooccurence
superior to 1 were kept in the analysis. Cooccurence analysis were done with the
`cooccur` R package [@griffith_cooccur_2016].

All the analysis were performed in R v3.6.3 [@r_core_team_r_2020] and the
scripts used for the analysis are available online [https://github.com/alaindanet/prie_mussels](https://github.com/alaindanet/prie_mussels).

# Results

## Composition

```{r nmds-test}
myload(result_compo, envir = environment(), dir = get_mypath("data"))
kable(result_compo,
  label = "nmds",
  caption = "Result of the fit of environmental variables
  onto ordination.")  %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))

```


```{r}
nmds_caption <- paste0(
  "Non Metrics Dimensional Scaling of species composition. Each point represent
  a site. The vectors represent the direction which the continuous variables
  change the most fastly in the ordination space and the direction which they
  have maximal correlation with the ordination. The label of the factors
  represent their average position in the ordination space."

) 
```

```{r nmds, fig.cap=nmds_caption}
include_graphics(path = get_mypath("fig", "nmds.png"))
```
The variables latitude, longitude, substrate and string distance were
significantly associated to the ordination axis, but not altitude (Figure
\@ref(fig:nmds), Table \@ref(tab:nmds)). Latitude and longitude were the
variables the most related to the community composition 
(resp. $r^2 = `r signif(result_compo$r[1], 2)`$,
$r^2 = `r signif(result_compo$r[2], 2)`$). 


## Species richness

```{r res-lm}
myload(lm_res_tab, lm_res_tab_to_print, envir = environment(),
  dir = get_mypath("data"))
mod <- lm_res_tab
bt_lm <- mod %>%
  mutate(
    `Estimate (original scale)` = exp(Estimate),
    `SE (original scale)` = `Estimate (original scale)` * SE,
    lower = Estimate - 1.96*SE, 
    upper = Estimate + 1.96*SE, 
  ) %>%
mutate_if(is.double, ~signif(., 2))


out <- lapply(split(bt_lm, seq(1, nrow(bt_lm))), function(x) lapply(1:nrow(x), head, x = x)) %>%
  unlist(bt_lm, recursive = FALSE)
names(out) <- bt_lm$Term
kable(lm_res_tab,
  label = "rich",
  caption = "Estimates and standard errors associated to the linear model of
  species richness.") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))
```
```{r}
myload(model.1, envir = environment(), dir = get_mypath("data"))
ci <- intervals(model.1, which = "fixed")$fixed %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "term")
bt_ci <- ci %>% 
  mutate_at(c("lower", "est.", "upper"), ~round(exp(.), 2))
```


```{r}
rich_cap <- paste0(
  "Relationships between species richness and environmental variables, namely
  (A) latitude, (B) longitude, (C) Distance from the source, (D) substrate type
  and (E) altitude. ",
  "Lines and ribbons represents respectively the mean prediction and its 95%
  confidence interval. ",
  "For (A) and (B), the chosen values of latitude and longitude correspond to
  the first (in red), the second (in green) and the third quartile (in blue)."
)
#Is you used log(y) instead of y, the model is
#log(y) = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + error
#what can be written as
#y = exp(b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + error)
   #= exp(b0) * exp(b1*x1) * exp(b2*x2) * exp(error)
   #= exp(b0) * exp(b1)^x1 * exp(b2)^x2 * exp(error)

```

We found that species richness increase by $`r out[["Latitude"]]$Estimate`$
log-unit ($`r out[["Latitude"]]$SE`$ se) by latitude degree and increased by
$`r out[["Spring distance"]]$Estimate`$ log-unit 
($`r out[["Spring distance"]]$SE`$ se) by meter distance from the spring (Figure
\@ref(fig:rich), Table \@ref(tab:rich)).
However, longitude and
altitude had no significant effects on species richness. We further found that
species richness was higher in acid and mixed substrate than in calcareous
substrate (respectively $`r out[["Acid"]]$Estimate`$ log-unit, 
$`r out[["Acid"]]$SE`$ se and $`r out[["Mixed"]]$Estimate`$ log-unit,
$`r out[["Mixed"]]$SE`$ se).

```{r rich, fig.cap=rich_cap}
