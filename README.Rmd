# multisimecol 

The goal of multisimecol is to make easier (1) to share models and simulation
and (2) to simulate models over a range of condition.

## Features

- Run model over a range of
  - parameter values 
  - initial conditions
  - number of replicates

- Average simulations:
  - keep the mean of variable values over the n last timesteps

- Create a object with all specifications of the simulations

## Coming features

- Run model with different equations set up
- Default plot methods
- Simulate of multisim object with `sim()`
- Set a function to specify how to resume simulations

# How to install

You can install the package with devtools

```{r}
devtools::install_github("alaindanet/multisimecol")
```
